/*
mirostat_tau
Controls the balance between coherence and diversity of the output.
A lower value will result in more focused and coherent text.
(Default: 5.0)	float	mirostat_tau 5.0

top_k
Reduces the probability of generating nonsense.
A higher value (e.g. 100) will give more diverse answers,
while a lower value (e.g. 10) will be more conservative.
(Default: 40)	int	top_k 40

top_p
Works together with top-k. A higher value (e.g., 0.95) will lead to more diverse text,
while a lower value (e.g., 0.5) will generate more focused and conservative text.
(Default: 0.9)	float	top_p 0.9

tfs_z
Tail free sampling is used to reduce the impact of less probable tokens from the output.
A higher value (e.g., 2.0) will reduce the impact more,
while a value of 1.0 disables this setting.
(default: 1)	float	tfs_z 1
